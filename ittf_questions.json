Any Athlete or other Person seeking to challenge whether the conditions for such presumption have been met or to rebut this presumption of scientific validity shall, as a condition precedent to any such challenge, first notify WADA of the challenge and the basis of the challenge.

In cases before CAS, at WADA’s request, the CAS panel shall appoint an appropriate scientific expert to assist the panel in its evaluation of the challenge. 13 (2) WADA-accredited laboratories, and other laboratories approved by WADA, are presumed to have conducted Sample analysis and custodial procedures in accordance with the International Standard for Laboratories. The Athlete or other Person may rebut this presumption by establishing that a departure from the International Standard for Laboratories occurred which could reasonably have caused the Adverse Analytical Finding. If the Athlete or other Person rebuts the preceding presumption by showing that a departure from the International Standard for Laboratories occurred which could reasonably have caused the Adverse Analytical Finding, then ITTF shall have the burden to establish that such departure did not cause the Adverse Analytical Finding. 14 (3) Departures from any other International Standard or other anti-doping rule or policy set forth in the Code or these Anti-Doping Rules shall not invalidate analytical results or other evidence of an anti-doping rule violation, and shall not constitute a defense to an anti-doping rule violation; 15 provided, however, 12  [Comment to Article 5.3.2: For example, ITTF may establish an anti -doping rule violation under Article  5.2.2 based on the Athlete’s admissions, the credible testimony of third Persons, reliable documentary evidence, reliable analytical data from either an  A or B Sample as provided in the Comments to Article  5.2.2, or conclusions drawn from the profile of a series of the Athlete’s blood or urine Samples, such as data from the Athlete Biological Passport.] 13  [Comment to Article 5.3.2.1: For certain Prohibited Substances, WADA may instruct WADA -accredited laboratories not to report Samples as an Adverse Analytical Finding if the estimated concentration of the Prohibited Substance or its Metabolites or Mar kers is below a Minimum Reporting Level.

      "Prohibited Substances and Prohibited Methods Identified on the Prohibited List (1) Prohibited Substances and Prohibited Methods The Prohibited List shall identify those Prohibited Substances and Prohibited Methods which are prohibited as doping at all times (both In-Competition and Out-of-Competition) because of their potential to enhance performance in future Competitions or their masking potential, and those substances and methods which are prohibited In-Competition only. The Prohibited List may be expanded by WADA for a particular sport. Prohibited Substances  and Prohibited Methods may be included in the Prohibited List by general category (e.g., anabolic agents) or by specific reference to a particular substance or method. 18 (2) Specified Substances or Specified Methods For purposes of the application of Article 5.10, all Prohibited Substances shall be Specified Substances except as identified on the Prohibited List . No Prohibited Method shall be a Specified Method unless it is specifically identified as a Specified Method on the Prohibited List.19 (3) Substances of Abuse 17  [Comment to Article 5.4.1: The current Prohibited List is available on WADA's website at https://www.wada-ama.org. The Prohibited List will be revised and published on an expedited basis whenever the need arises. However, for the sake of predictability, a  new Prohibited List will be published every year whether or not changes have been made.] 18  [Comment to Article 5.4.2.1: Out-of-Competition Use of a substance which is only prohibited In -Competition is not an anti-doping rule violation unless an Adverse Analytical Finding for the substance or its Metabolites or Markers is reported for a Sample co llected In- Competition.] 19  [Comment to Article 5.4.2.2: The Specified Substances and Methods identified in Article 5.4.2.2 should not in any way be considered less important or less dangerous than other doping substances or methods. Rather, they are simply substances and methods whic h are more likely to have been consumed or used by an Athlete for a purpose other than the enhancement of sport performance.] 5: ITTF Anti-Doping Rules ITTF Statutes 2025 Page 110 For purposes of applying Article 5.10, Substances of Abuse shall include those Prohibited Substances  which are specifically identified as Substances of Abuse on the Prohibited List because they are frequently abused in society outside of the context of sport.",

(6) Expiration, Withdrawal or Reversal of a TUE (1) A TUE granted pursuant to these Anti-Doping Rules: (a) shall expire automatically at the end of any term for which it was granted, without the need for any further notice or other formality; (b) will be withdrawn if the Athlete does not promptly comply with any requirements or conditions imposed by the TUEC upon grant of the TUE; (c) may be withdrawn by the TUEC if it is subsequently determined that the criteria for grant of a TUE are not in fact met; or (d) may be reversed on review by WADA or on appeal. (2) In such event, the Athlete shall not be subject to any Consequences based on their Use or Possession or Administration of the Prohibited Substance or Prohibited Method in question in accordance with the TUE prior to the effective date of expiry, withdrawal, or reversal of the TUE. The review pursuant to Article 5.1.1.1 of the International Standard for Results Management  of an Adverse Analytical Finding, reported shortly after the TUE expiry, withdrawal or reversal, shall include consideration of whether such finding is consistent with Use of the Prohibited Substance or Prohibited Method prior to that date, in which event no anti-doping rule violation shall be asserted. (7) Reviews and Appeals of TUE Decisions (1) WADA must review ITTF’s decision not to recognize a TUE granted by the National Anti-Doping Organization that is referred to WADA by the Athlete or the Athlete’s National Anti-Doping Organization. In addition, WADA must review ITTF’s decision to grant a TUE that is referred to WADA by the Athlete’s National Anti-Doping Organization. WADA may review any other TUE decisions at any time, whether upon request by those affected or on its own 5: ITTF Anti-Doping Rules ITTF Statutes 2025 Page 113 initiative. If the TUE decision being reviewed meets the criteria set out in the International Standard for Therapeutic Use Exemptions , WADA will not interfere with it. If the TUE decision does not meet those criteria, WADA will reverse it.22 (2) Any TUE decision by ITTF (or by a where it has agreed to consider the application on behalf of ITTF) that is not reviewed by WADA, or that is reviewed by WADA but is not reversed upon review, may be appealed by the Athlete and/or the Athlete’s National Anti-Doping Organization, exclusively to CAS.23 (3) A decision by WADA to reverse a TUE decision may be appealed by the Athlete, the National Anti-Doping Organization and/or ITTF, exclusively to CAS. (4) A failure to render a decision within a reasonable time on a properly submitted application for grant/recognition of a TUE or for review of a TUE decision shall be considered a denial of the application thus triggering the applicable rights of review/appeal.

Be Open: tell someone if you are approached 1.  Be Smart: know the rules Find out the sports betting integrity rules of the ITTF and your Member Association, team, club, Athletes’ Commission, competition and your country’s laws, before the start of each season so that you are aware of the ITTF’s most recent position regarding betting. Many sports and countries either have or are developing regulations on sports betting and you need to be aware of these – even if you do not bet. If you break the rules, you will be caught and risk severe punishment including a potential lifetime ban from table tennis and even being subject to a criminal investigation. 2.  Be Safe: never bet on table tennis Never bet on yourself, your opponent or table tennis. If you, or anyone in your entourage (coach, family members, etc .,), bet on you, your opponent or table tennis, you risk being severely sanctioned. It is best to play safe and never bet on any events within table tennis including: • never betting or gambling on your own matches or any competitions (including betting on yourself or your team to win, lose or draw as well as any of the different side-bets); • never instructing, encouraging or facilitating any other party to bet on table tennis; • never ensuring the occurrence of a particular incident, which is the subject of a bet and for which you expect to receive or have received any reward; •  never giving or receiving any gift, payment or other benefit in circumstances that might reasonably be expected to bring you or table tennis into disrepute. Code of Conduct on Sports Betting for Players and Officials ITTF Statutes 2025 Page 257 3.  Be Careful: never share sensitive information As a player or official you will have access to information that is not available to the general public, such as knowing that a star player is injured or that the coach is putting out a weakened side. This is considered sensitive, privileged or inside information. This information could be sought by people who would then use that knowledge to secure an unfair advantage and make a financial gain. There is nothing wrong with you having sensitive information; it is what you do with it that matters. Most players know that they should not discuss important information with anyone outside of their club or coaching staff (with or without reward) where th e player might reasonably be expected to know that its disclosure could be used in relation to betting. The same applies to officials. 4.  Be Clean: never fix an event Play and officiate fairly, honestly and never fix an event or part of an event. Whatever the reason, do not make any attempt to influence adversely the natural course of a table tennis event or part of an event. Sporting competitions must always be an honest test of skill and ability and the results must remain uncertain. Fixing an event, or part of an event goes against the rules and ethics of sport and when caught, you may receive a criminal prosecution and a lifetime ban from table tennis. Do not put yourself at risk by following these simple principles: • Always perform to the best of your abilities (play to your potential and umpire fairly). • Never accept to fix a match. Say no immediately. Do not let yourself be manipulated - unscrupulous individuals might try to develop a relationship with you built on favours or fears that they will then try to exploit for their benefit in possibly fixing an event. This can include the offer of gifts, money or other support. • Avoid addictions or running up debts as this may be a trigger for unscrupulous individuals to target you to fix competitions. Get help before things get out of control. 5.  Be Open: tell someone if you are approached If you hear something suspicious or if anyone approaches you to ask about fixing any part of a match then you should tell the Athletes’ Commission, the ITTF (competition manager or referee), the Umpires and Referees Committee (if you are a technical official) or someone you trust straight away. If someone offers you money or favours for sensitive information then you should also tell the ITTF or Athletes’ Commission. Any threats or suspicions of corrupt behaviour must always be reported. The police and national laws are there to protect you. Your club, your Association or your Athletes’ Commission will help. If in doubt as to who to contact, email: integrity@ittf.com."
