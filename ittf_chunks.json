(5) Unless otherwise authorised by the umpire, players shall leave their rackets on the table during intervals; but if the racket is strapped to the hand, the umpire shall allow the player to retain his or her racket strapped to the hand during intervals.",

(3) The request for a time-out, which can be made only between rallies in a game, shall be indicated by making a \"T\" sign with the hands.

(3) There shall be no intervals between successive individual matches of a team match except that a player who is required to play in successive matches may claim an interval of up to 5 minutes between those matches. (4) The referee may allow a suspension of play, of the shortest practical duration, and in no circumstances more than 10 minutes, if a player is temporarily incapacitated by an accident, provided that in the opinion of the referee the suspension is not likely to be unduly disadvantageous to the opposing player or pair. (5) A suspension shall not be allowed for a disability which was present or was reasonably to be expected at the beginning of the match, or where it is due to the normal stress of play; disability such as cramp or exhaustion, caused by the player's current state of fitness or by the manner in which play has proceeded, does not justify such an emergency suspension, which may be allowed only for incapacity resulting from an accident, such as injury caused by a fall. (6) If anyone in the playing area is bleeding, play shall be suspended immediately and shall not resume until that person has received medical treatment and all traces of blood have been removed from the playing area. (7) Players shall remain in or near the playing area throughout an individual match, except with the permission of the referee; during intervals between games and time-outs they shall remain within 3 metres of the playing area, under the supervision of the umpire.",

ITTF Statutes 2025 Page 100 5 ANTI-DOPING RULES INTRODUCTION Preface These Anti-Doping Rules are adopted and implemented in accordance with ITTF's responsibilities under the Code, and in furtherance of ITTF's continuing efforts to eradicate doping in sport. These Anti-Doping Rules are sport rules governing the conditions under which sport is played. Aimed at enforcing anti-doping rules in a global and harmonized manner, they are distinct in nature from criminal and civil laws. They are not intended to be subject to or limited by any national requirements and legal standards applicable to criminal or civil proceedings, although they are intended to be applied in a manner which respects the principles of proportionality and human rights. When reviewing the facts and the law of a given case, all courts, arbitral tribunals and other adjudicating bodies should be aware of and respect the distinct nature of these Anti-Doping Rules, which implement the Code, and the fact that these rules represent the consensus of a broad spectrum of stakeholders around the world as to what is necessary to protect and ensure fair sport. As provided in the Code, ITTF shall be responsible for conducting all aspects of Doping Control. Any aspect of Doping Control or anti-doping Education may be delegated by ITTF to a Delegated Third Party, such as the International Testing Agency (ITA), however, ITTF shall require the Delegated Third Party  to perform such aspects in compliance with the Code, International Standards , and these Anti-Doping Rules. ITTF has delegated its adjudication responsibilities and parts of the Results Management to the CAS Anti-Doping Division. When ITTF has delegated its responsibilities to implement part or all of Doping Control to the ITA or to other Delegated Third Party, any reference to ITTF in these Rules should be intended as a reference to the ITA or to the other Delegated Third Party, where applicable and within the context of the aforementioned delegation. ITTF shall always remain fully responsible for ensuring that any delegated aspects are performed in compliance with the Code. Italicized terms in these Anti-Doping Rules are defined terms in Appendix 1. Unless otherwise specified, references to Articles are references to Articles of these Anti- Doping Rules. Fundamental Rationale for the Code and ITTF's Anti-Doping Rules Anti-doping programs are founded on the intrinsic value of sport. This intrinsic value is often referred to as \"the spirit of sport\": the ethical pursuit of human excellence through the dedicated perfection of each Athlete's natural talents. Anti-doping programs seek to protect the health of Athletes and to provide the opportunity for Athletes to pursue human excellence without the Use of Prohibited Substances and Methods. 5: ITTF Anti-Doping Rules ITTF Statutes 2025 Page 101 Anti-doping programs seek to maintain the integrity of sport in terms of respect for rules, other competitors, fair competition, a level playing field, and the value of clean sport to the world. The spirit of sport is the celebration of the human spirit, body and mind. It is the essence of Olympism and is reflected in the values we find in and through sport, including: • Health • Ethics, fair play and honesty • Athletes' rights as set forth in the Code • Excellence in performance • Character and Education • Fun and joy • Teamwork • Dedication and commitment • Respect for rules and laws • Respect for self and other Participants • Courage • Community and solidarity The spirit of sport is expressed in how we play true. Doping is fundamentally contrary to the spirit of sport. Scope of these Anti-Doping Rules These Anti-Doping Rules shall apply to: (a) ITTF, including its board members, directors, officers and specified employees, and Delegated Third Parties and their employees, who are involved in any aspect of Doping Control; (b) Continental and Regional Federations recognized by the ITTF, including their including its board members, directors, officers and specified employees, and Delegated Third Parties and their employees, who are involved in any aspect of Doping Control; (c) each of its Member Associations, including their board members, directors, officers and specified employees, and Delegated Third Parties and their employees, who are involved in any aspect of Doping Control; (d) the following Athletes, Athlete Support Personnel and other Persons: i. all Athletes and Athlete Support Personnel who are members of ITTF, or of any Member Association, or of any member or affiliate organization of any Member Association (including any clubs, teams, associations, or leagues); ii. all Athletes and Athlete Support Personnel who participate in such capacity in Events, Competitions and other activities organized, convened, authorized or recognized by ITTF, or any Member Association, or by any member or affiliate organization of any Member Association (including any clubs, teams, associations, or leagues), wherever held; iii. any other Athlete or Athlete Support Personnel or other Person who, by virtue of an accreditation, a license or other contractual arrangement, or otherwise, is subject to the authority of ITTF, or of any Member Association, or of any 5: ITTF Anti-Doping Rules ITTF Statutes 2025 Page 102 member or affiliate organization of any Member Association (including any clubs, teams, associations, or leagues), for purposes of anti-doping; and iv. Athletes who are not regular members of ITTF or of one of its Member Associations but who want to be eligible to compete in a particular International Event. Each of the abovementioned Persons is deemed, as a condition of his or her participation or involvement in the sport, to have agreed to and be bound by these Anti-Doping Rules, and to have submitted to the authority of ITTF to enforce these Anti-Doping Rules, including any Consequences for the breach thereof, and to the jurisdiction of the hearing panels specified in Article 5.8 and Article 5.13 to hear and determine cases and appeals brought under these Anti-Doping Rules 1. Within the overall pool of Athletes set out above who are bound by and required to comply with these Anti-Doping Rules, the following Athletes shall be considered to be International- Level Athletes for the purposes of these Anti-Doping Rules, and, therefore, the specific provisions in these Anti-Doping Rules applicable to International-Level Athletes (e.g., Testing, TUEs, whereabouts, and Results Management) shall apply to such Athletes: (a) For each year, the first 250 Men and 200 Women in the January General List of ITTF World Ranking, available at ranking.ittf.com (b) For each year, the first 8 Men and 8 Women in each Class in the January Para Table Tennis rating, available on ipttc.org/rating. (c) All Athletes included in the ITTF Registered Testing Pool and any Testing Pool established by the ITTF. (d) Any other Athletes who, at any moment of the year, reach the top 100 in the General World Ranking, or the top 4 in the Para Table Tennis Ranking. The aforesaid rankings are published on ITTF's website. ARTICLE 5.1 DEFINITION OF DOPING Doping is defined as the occurrence of one or more of the anti-doping rule violations set forth in Article 5.2.1 through Article 5.2.11 of these Anti-Doping Rules. ARTICLE 5.2 ANTI-DOPING RULE VIOLATIONS The purpose of Article 5.2 is to specify the circumstances and conduct which constitute anti- doping rule violations. Hearings in doping cases will proceed based on the assertion that one or more of these specific rules have been violated. 1  [Comment: Where the Code requires a Person other than an Athlete or Athlete Support Person to be bound by the Code, such Person would of course not be subject to Sample collection or Testing, and would not be subject to an anti -doping rule violation under the Code for Use or Possession of a Prohibited Substance or Prohibit ed Method. Rather, such Person would only be subject to discipline for a violation of Code Articles 2.5 (Tampering), 2.7 (Trafficking), 2.8 (Administration), 2.9 (Complicity), 2.10 (Prohibited  Association) and 2.11 (Retaliation). Furthermore, such Person would be subject to the additional roles and responsibilities according to Code Article",

Within ten (10) days of WADA’s receipt of such notice and the case file related to such challenge, WADA shall also have the right to intervene as a party, appear as amicus curiae or otherwise provide evidence in such proceeding. In cases before CAS, at WADA’s request, the CAS panel shall appoint an appropriate scientific expert to assist the panel in its evaluation of the challenge. 13 (2) WADA-accredited laboratories, and other laboratories approved by WADA, are presumed to have conducted Sample analysis and custodial procedures in accordance with the International Standard for Laboratories. The Athlete or other Person may rebut this presumption by establishing that a departure from the International Standard for Laboratories occurred which could reasonably have caused the Adverse Analytical Finding. If the Athlete or other Person rebuts the preceding presumption by showing that a departure from the International Standard for Laboratories occurred which could reasonably have caused the Adverse Analytical Finding, then ITTF shall have the burden to establish that such departure did not cause the Adverse Analytical Finding. 14 (3) Departures from any other International Standard or other anti-doping rule or policy set forth in the Code or these Anti-Doping Rules shall not invalidate analytical results or other evidence of an anti-doping rule violation, and shall not constitute a defense to an anti-doping rule violation; 15 provided, however, 12  [Comment to Article 5.3.2: For example, ITTF may establish an anti -doping rule violation under Article  5.2.2 based on the Athlete’s admissions, the credible testimony of third Persons, reliable documentary evidence, reliable analytical data from either an  A or B Sample as provided in the Comments to Article  5.2.2, or conclusions drawn from the profile of a series of the Athlete’s blood or urine Samples, such as data from the Athlete Biological Passport.] 13  [Comment to Article 5.3.2.1: For certain Prohibited Substances, WADA may instruct WADA -accredited laboratories not to report Samples as an Adverse Analytical Finding if the estimated concentration of the Prohibited Substance or its Metabolites or Mar kers is below a Minimum Reporting Level.

(2) TUE Applications (1) Athletes who are not International-Level Athletes shall apply to their National Anti-Doping Organization for a TUE. If the National Anti-Doping Organization denies the application, the Athlete may appeal exclusively to the national-level appeal body described in Article 5.13.2.2. (2) Athletes who are International-Level Athletes shall apply to ITTF. (3) TUE Recognition 20 (1) Where the Athlete already has a TUE granted by their National Anti-Doping Organization pursuant to Article 4.4 of the Code for the substance or method in question and provided that such TUE has been reported in accordance with Article 5.5 of the International Standard for Therapeutic Use Exemptions, ITTF will automatically recognize it for purposes of international-level Competition without the need to review the relevant clinical information.

(2) An application to ITTF for grant or recognition of a TUE must be made as soon as possible, save where Articles 4.1 or 4.3 of the International Standard for Therapeutic Use Exemptions  apply. The application shall be made in accordance with Article 6 of the International Standard for Therapeutic Use Exemptions as posted on ITTF’s website. (3) ITTF shall stablish a Therapeutic Use Exemption Committee (“TUEC”) to consider applications for the grant or recognition of TUEs in accordance with Article 5.4.4.4.3(a)-(d) below: (a) The TUEC shall consist of a minimum of five (5) members with experience in the care and treatment of Athletes and sound knowledge of clinical, sports and exercise medicine. (b) Before serving as a member of the TUEC, each member must sign a conflict of interest and confidentiality declaration. The appointed members shall not be employees of ITTF. (c) When an application to ITTF for the grant or recognition of a TUE is made, three (3) members (which may include the Chair) shall be appointed to consider the application. (d)  Before considering a TUE application, each member shall disclose any circumstances likely to affect their impartiality with respect to the Athlete making the application. If a member is unwilling or unable to assess the Athlete’s TUE application, for any reason, a replacement or a new TUEC shall be appointed (e.g., from the pool of members appointed under point (a) above). The Chair cannot serve as a member of the TUEC if there are any circumstances which are likely to affect the impartiality of the TUE decision. (4) The TUEC shall promptly evaluate and decide upon the application in accordance with the relevant provisions of the International Standard for Therapeutic Use Exemptions  and usually (i.e., unless exceptional circumstances apply) within no more than twenty-one (21) days of receipt of a complete application. Where the application is made in a reasonable time prior to an Event, the TUEC must use its best endeavours to issue its decision before the start of the Event. (5) The TUEC decision shall be the final decision of ITTF and may be appealed in accordance with Article 5.4.4.7. ITTF TUEC decision shall be notified in writing to the Athlete, and to WADA and other Anti-Doping Organizations in 21  [Comment to Article 5.4.4.4: The submission of falsified documents to a TUEC or ITTF, offering or accepting a bribe to a Pers on to perform or fail to perform an act, procuring false testimony from any witness, or committing any other fraudulent act or any other similar intentional interference or Attempted interference with any aspect of the TUE process shall result in a charge of Tampering o r Attempted Tampering under Article 5.2.5.

It shall also promptly be reported into ADAMS. (6) If ITTF (or the National Anti-Doping Organization, where it has agreed to consider the application on behalf of ITTF) denies the Athlete’s application, it must notify the Athlete promptly, with reasons. If ITTF grants the Athlete’s application, it must notify not only the Athlete but also their National Anti- Doping Organization. If the National Anti-Doping Organization considers that the TUE granted by ITTF does not meet the criteria set out in the International Standard for Therapeutic Use Exemptions, it has twenty-one (21) days from such notification to refer the matter to WADA for review in accordance with Article 5.4.4.7. If the National Anti-Doping Organization refers the matter to WADA for review, the TUE granted by ITTF remains valid for international-level Competition and Out-of-Competition Testing (but is not valid for national-level Competition) pending WADA’s decision. If the National Anti-Doping Organization does not refer the matter to WADA for review, the TUE granted by ITTF becomes valid for national-level Competition as well when the twenty-one (21) day review deadline expires. (5) Retroactive TUE  Applications If ITTF chooses to collect a Sample from an Athlete who is not an International- Level Athlete or a National-Level Athlete, and that Athlete is Using a Prohibited Substance or Prohibited Method for therapeutic reasons, ITTF must permit that Athlete to apply for a retroactive TUE. (6) Expiration, Withdrawal or Reversal of a TUE (1) A TUE granted pursuant to these Anti-Doping Rules: (a) shall expire automatically at the end of any term for which it was granted, without the need for any further notice or other formality; (b) will be withdrawn if the Athlete does not promptly comply with any requirements or conditions imposed by the TUEC upon grant of the TUE; (c) may be withdrawn by the TUEC if it is subsequently determined that the criteria for grant of a TUE are not in fact met; or (d) may be reversed on review by WADA or on appeal. (2) In such event, the Athlete shall not be subject to any Consequences based on their Use or Possession or Administration of the Prohibited Substance or Prohibited Method in question in accordance with the TUE prior to the effective date of expiry, withdrawal, or reversal of the TUE. The review pursuant to Article 5.1.1.1 of the International Standard for Results Management  of an Adverse Analytical Finding, reported shortly after the TUE expiry, withdrawal or reversal, shall include consideration of whether such finding is consistent with Use of the Prohibited Substance or Prohibited Method prior to that date, in which event no anti-doping rule violation shall be asserted. (7) Reviews and Appeals of TUE Decisions (1) WADA must review ITTF’s decision not to recognize a TUE granted by the National Anti-Doping Organization that is referred to WADA by the Athlete or the Athlete’s National Anti-Doping Organization. In addition, WADA must review ITTF’s decision to grant a TUE that is referred to WADA by the Athlete’s National Anti-Doping Organization. WADA may review any other TUE decisions at any time, whether upon request by those affected or on its own 5: ITTF Anti-Doping Rules ITTF Statutes 2025 Page 113 initiative. If the TUE decision being reviewed meets the criteria set out in the International Standard for Therapeutic Use Exemptions , WADA will not interfere with it. If the TUE decision does not meet those criteria, WADA will reverse it.22 (2) Any TUE decision by ITTF (or by a where it has agreed to consider the application on behalf of ITTF) that is not reviewed by WADA, or that is reviewed by WADA but is not reversed upon review, may be appealed by the Athlete and/or the Athlete’s National Anti-Doping Organization, exclusively to CAS.23 (3) A decision by WADA to reverse a TUE decision may be appealed by the Athlete, the National Anti-Doping Organization and/or ITTF, exclusively to CAS. (4) A failure to render a decision within a reasonable time on a properly submitted application for grant/recognition of a TUE or for review of a TUE decision shall be considered a denial of the application thus triggering the applicable rights of review/appeal.

(1) Specified Substances or Specified Methods Where the anti-doping rule violation involves a Specified Substance (other than a Substance of Abuse) or Specified Method, and the Athlete or other Person can establish No Significant Fault or Negligence , then the period of Ineligibility shall be, at a minimum, a reprimand and no period of Ineligibility, and at a maximum, two (2) years of Ineligibility, depending on the Athlete’s or other Person’s degree of Fault.

They will only apply in exceptional circumstances, for example, where an Athlete could prove that, despite all due care, he or she was sabotaged by a competitor. Conversely, No Fault or Negligence would not apply in the following circumstances: (a) a posi tive test resulting from a mislabelled or contaminated vitamin or nutritional supplement (Athletes are responsible for what they ingest (Article  5.2.1) and have been warned against the possibility of supplement contamination); (b) the Administration of a Prohibited Substance by the Athlete’s p ersonal physician or trainer without disclosure to the Athlete (Athletes are responsible for their choice of medical personnel and for advising medical personnel that they cann ot be given any Prohibited Substance); and (c) sabotage of the Athlete’s food or drink by a spouse, coach or other Person within the Athlete’s circle of associates (Athletes are responsible for what they ingest and for the conduct of those Persons to whom they entrust  access to their food and drink). However, depending on the unique f acts of a particular case, any of the referenced illustrations could result in a reduced sanction under Article 5.10.6 based on No Significant Fault or Negligence.] 48  [Comment to Article 5.10.6.1.2: In order to receive the benefit of this Article, the Athlete or other Person must establish n ot only that the detected Prohibited Substance came from a Contaminated Product, but must also separately establish No Significant Fault or Negligence. It should be further noted that Athletes are on notice that they take nutritional supplements at their own risk. The sanction reduction based on No Significant Fault or Negligence has rarely been applied in Contaminated Product cases  unless the Athlete has exercised a high level of caution before taking the Contaminated Product. In assessing whether the Athlete can establish the source of the Prohibited Substance, it would, for example, be significant for purposes of establishing whether the Athlete actually Used the Contaminated Product, whether the Athlete had declared the product which was subsequently determined to be contaminated on th e Doping Control form. This Article should not be extended beyond products that have gone through some process of manufacturing. Where an Adverse Analytical Finding results from environment contamination of a “non -product” such as tap water or lake water in circumstances where no reasonable person would e xpect any risk of an anti -doping rule violation, typically there would be No Fault or Negligence under Article 5.10.5.] 5: ITTF Anti-Doping Rules ITTF Statutes 2025 Page 129 and no period of Ineligibility, and at a maximum, two (2) years Ineligibility, depending on the Protected Person or Recreational Athlete’s degree of Fault. (2) Application of No Significant Fault or Negligence  beyond the Application of Article 5.10.6.1 If an Athlete or other Person establishes in an individual case where Article (1) is not applicable that he or she bears No Significant Fault or Negligence, then, subject to further reduction or elimination as provided in Article 5.10.7, the otherwise applicable period of Ineligibility may be reduced based on the Athlete or other Person’s degree of Fault, but the reduced period of Ineligibility may not be less than one-half of the period of Ineligibility otherwise applicable.

In exceptional circumstances, WADA may agree to suspensions of the period of Ineligibility and other Consequences for Substantial Assistance greater than those otherwise provided in this Article, or even no period of Ineligibility, no mandatory Public Disclosure and/or no return of prize money or payment of fines or costs. WADA’s approval shall be subject to reinstatement of Consequences, as otherwise provided in this Article. Notwithstanding Article 5.13, WADA’s decisions in the context of this Article (2) may not be appealed.

However: (1) Anti-doping rule violations taking place prior to the Effective Date count as \"first violations\" or \"second violations\" for purposes of determining sanctions under Article 5.10 for violations taking place after the Effective Date. (2) Any anti-doping rule violation case which is pending as of the Effective Date and any anti-doping rule violation case brought after the Effective Date based on an anti-doping rule violation which occurred prior to the Effective Date, shall be governed by the substantive anti-doping rules in effect at the time the alleged anti-doping rule violation occurred, and not by the substantive anti- doping rules set out in these Anti-Doping Rules, unless the panel hearing the case determines the principle of “lex mitior” appropriately applies under the circumstances of the case. For these purposes, the retrospective periods in which prior violations can be considered for purposes of multiple violations under Article 5.10.9.4 and the statute of limitations set forth in Article 5.16 are procedural rules, not substantive rules, and should be applied retroactively along with all of the other procedural rules in these Anti-Doping Rules (provided, however, that Article 5.16 shall only be applied retroactively if the statute of limitation period has not already expired by the Effective Date). (3) Any Article 5.2.4 whereabouts failure (whether a filing failure or a missed test, as those terms are defined in the International Standard for Results Management) prior to the Effective Date shall be carried forward and may be relied upon, prior to expiry, in accordance with the International Standard for Results Management , but it shall be deemed to have expired twelve (12) months after it occurred. (4) With respect to cases where a final decision finding an anti-doping rule violation has been rendered prior to the Effective Date, but the Athlete or other Person is still serving the period of Ineligibility as of the Effective Date, the Athlete or other Person may apply to ITTF or other Anti-Doping Organization which had Results Management responsibility for the anti-doping rule violation to consider a reduction in the period of Ineligibility in light of these Anti-Doping Rules. Such application must be made before the period of Ineligibility has expired. The decision rendered may be appealed pursuant to Article 5.13.2. These Anti-Doping Rules shall have no application to any case where a final decision finding an anti-doping rule violation has been rendered and the period of Ineligibility has expired. (5) For purposes of assessing the period of Ineligibility for a second violation under Article 5.10.9.1, where the sanction for the first violation was determined based on rules in force prior to the Effective Date, the period of Ineligibility 5: ITTF Anti-Doping Rules ITTF Statutes 2025 Page 154 which would have been assessed for that first violation had these Anti-Doping Rules been applicable, shall be applied.74 (6) Changes to the Prohibited List  and Technical Documents relating to substances or methods on the Prohibited List shall not, unless they specifically provide otherwise, be applied retroactively. As an exception, however, when a Prohibited Substance or a Prohibited Method has been removed from the Prohibited List , an Athlete or other Person currently serving a period of Ineligibility on account of the formerly Prohibited Substance or Prohibited Method may apply to ITTF or other Anti-Doping Organization which had Results Management  responsibility for the anti-doping rule violation to consider a reduction in the period of Ineligibility in light of the removal of the substance or method from the Prohibited List. 74  [Comment to Article 5.24.7.5: Other than the situation described in Article 5.24.7.5, where a final decision finding an anti -doping rule violation has been rendered prior to the Effective Date and the period of Ineligibility imposed has been completely served, these Anti- Doping Rules may not be used to re -characterize the prior violation.] 5: ITTF Anti-Doping Rules ITTF Statutes 2025 Page 155 APPENDIX 1: DEFINITIONS 75 ADAMS: The Anti-Doping Administration and Management System is a Web-based database management tool for data entry, storage, sharing, and reporting designed to assist stakeholders and WADA in their anti-doping operations in conjunction with data protection legislation. Administration: Providing, supplying, supervising, facilitating, or otherwise participating in the Use or Attempted Use by another Person of a Prohibited Substance or Prohibited Method. However, this definition shall not include the actions of bona fide medical personnel involving a Prohibited Substance or Prohibited Method used for genuine and legal therapeutic purposes or other acceptable justification and shall not include actions involving Prohibited Substances which are not prohibited in Out-of-Competition Testing unless the circumstances as a whole demonstrate that such Prohibited Substances are not intended for genuine and legal therapeutic purposes or are intended to enhance sport performance. Adverse Analytical Finding: A report from a WADA-accredited laboratory or other WADA- approved laboratory that, consistent with the International Standard for Laboratories, establishes in a Sample the presence of a Prohibited Substance or its Metabolites or Markers or evidence of the Use of a Prohibited Method. Adverse Passport Finding: A report identified as an Adverse Passport Finding as described in the applicable International Standards. Aggravating Circumstances: Circumstances involving, or actions by, an Athlete or other Person which may justify the imposition of a period of Ineligibility greater than the standard sanction. Such circumstances and actions shall include, but are not limited to: the Athlete or other Person Used or Possessed multiple Prohibited Substances or Prohibited Methods, Used or Possessed a Prohibited Substance or Prohibited Method on multiple occasions or committed multiple other anti-doping rule violations; a normal individual would be likely to enjoy the performance-enhancing effects of the anti-doping rule violation(s) beyond the otherwise applicable period of Ineligibility; the Athlete or Person engaged in deceptive or obstructive conduct to avoid the detection or adjudication of an anti-doping rule violation; or the Athlete or other Person engaged in Tampering during Results Management. For the avoidance of doubt, the examples of circumstances and conduct described herein are not exclusive and other similar circumstances or conduct may also justify the imposition of a longer period of Ineligibility. Anti-Doping Activities: Anti-doping Education and information, test distribution planning, maintenance of a Registered Testing Pool, managing Athlete Biological Passports , conducting Testing, organizing analysis of Samples, gathering of intelligence and conduct of investigations, processing of TUE applications, Results Management , monitoring and enforcing compliance with any Consequences imposed, and all other activities related to anti-doping to be carried out by or on behalf of an Anti-Doping Organization, as set out in the Code and/or the International Standards. Anti-Doping Organization: WADA or a Signatory that is responsible for adopting rules for initiating, implementing or enforcing any part of the Doping Control process. This includes, 75  [Comment to Definitions: Defined terms shall include their plural and possessive forms, as well as those terms used as other parts of speech.] 5: ITTF Anti-Doping Rules ITTF Statutes 2025 Page 156 for example, the International Olympic Committee, the International Paralympic Committee, other Major Event Organizations  that conduct Testing at their Events, International Federations, and National Anti-Doping Organizations. Athlete: Any Person who competes in sport at the international level (as defined by each International Federation) or the national level (as defined by each National Anti-Doping Organization). An Anti-Doping Organization has discretion to apply anti-doping rules to an Athlete who is neither an International-Level Athlete nor a National-Level Athlete, and thus to bring them within the definition of “ Athlete”. In relation to Athletes who are neither International-Level nor National-Level Athletes, an Anti-Doping Organization may elect to: conduct limited Testing or no Testing at all; analyse Samples for less than the full menu of Prohibited Substances; require limited or no whereabouts information; or not require advance TUEs. However, if an Article 5.2.1, 5.2.3 or 5.2.5 anti -doping rule violation is committed by any Athlete over whom an Anti-Doping Organization has elected to exercise its authority to test and who competes below the international or national level, then the Consequences set forth in the Code must be applied. For purposes of Article 5.2.8 and Article 5.2.9 and for purposes of anti-doping information and Education, any Person who participates in sport under the authority of any Signatory, government, or other sports organization accepting the Code is an Athlete. 76 Athlete Biological Passport : The program and methods of gathering and collating data as described in the International Standard for Testing and Investigations and International Standard for Laboratories. Athlete Support Personnel: Any coach, trainer, manager, agent, team staff, official, medical, paramedical personnel, parent or any other Person working with, treating or assisting an Athlete participating in or preparing for sports Competition. Attempt: Purposely engaging in conduct that constitutes a substantial step in a course of conduct planned to culminate in the commission of an anti-doping rule violation. Provided, however, there shall be no anti-doping rule violation based solely on an Attempt to commit a violation if the Person renounces the Attempt prior to it being discovered by a third party not involved in the Attempt. Atypical Finding: A report from a WADA-accredited laboratory or other WADA-approved laboratory which requires further investigation as provided by the International Standard for Laboratories or related Technical Documents prior to the determination of an Adverse Analytical Finding. Atypical Passport Finding: A report described as an Atypical Passport Finding as described in the applicable International Standards. CAS: The Court of Arbitration for Sport. Code: The World Anti-Doping Code. 76  [Comment to Athlete: Individuals who participate in sport may fall in one of five categories: 1) International -Level Athlete, 2) National- Level Athlete, 3) individuals who are not International - or National -Level Athletes but over whom the International Federation or National Anti -Doping Organization has chosen to exercise authority, 4) Recreational Athlete, and 5) individuals over whom no International Federation or National Anti-Doping Organization has, or has chosen to, exercise authority. All International- and National- Level Athletes are subject to the anti -doping rules of the Code, with the precise definitions of international and national level sport to be set forth in the anti-doping rules of the International Federations and National Anti -Doping Organizations.] 5: ITTF Anti-Doping Rules ITTF Statutes 2025 Page 157 Competition: A single race, match, game or singular sport contest. For example, a basketball game or the finals of the Olympic 100-meter race in athletics. For stage races and other sport contests where prizes are awarded on a daily or other interim basis the distinc tion between a Competition and an Event will be as provided in the rules of ITTF. A Competition is an event for Singles, Doubles Pairs or Teams. Continental and Regional Federations: Groups of ITTF Member Associations recognized by the ITTF to which the ITTF can delegate the organization of certain Continental or Regional events. Consequences of Anti-Doping Rule Violations (“Consequences”): An Athlete's or other Person's violation of an anti-doping rule may result in one or more of the following: (a) Disqualification means the Athlete’s results in a particular Competition or Event are invalidated, with all resulting Consequences including forfeiture of any medals, points and prizes; (b) Ineligibility means the Athlete or other Person is barred on account of an anti- doping rule violation for a specified period of time from participating in any Competition or other activity or funding as provided in Article 5.10.14; (c) Provisional Suspension means the Athlete or other Person is barred temporarily from participating in any Competition or activity prior to the final decision at a hearing conducted under Article 5.8; (d) Financial Consequences means a financial sanction imposed for an anti-doping rule violation or to recover costs associated with an anti-doping rule violation; and (e) Public Disclosure means the dissemination or distribution of information to the general public or Persons beyond those Persons entitled to earlier notification in accordance with Article 5.14. Teams in Team Sports may also be subject to Consequences as provided in Article 5.11. Contaminated Product: A product that contains a Prohibited Substance that is not disclosed on the product label or in information available in a reasonable Internet search. Decision Limit: The value of the result for a threshold substance in a Sample, above which an Adverse Analytical Finding shall be reported, as defined in the International Standard for Laboratories. Delegated Third Party: Any Person to which ITTF delegates any aspect of Doping Control or anti-doping Education programs including, but not limited to, third parties or other Anti- Doping Organizations that conduct Sample collection or other Doping Control services or anti-doping Educational programs for ITTF, or individuals serving as independent contractors who perform Doping Control services for ITTF (e.g., non-employee Doping Control officers or chaperones). This definition does not include CAS. Disqualification: See Consequences of Anti-Doping Rule Violations above. Doping Control: All steps and processes from test distribution planning through to ultimate disposition of any appeal and the enforcement of Consequences, including all steps and processes in between, including but not limited to Testing, investigations, whereabouts, TUEs, Sample collection and handling, laboratory analysis, Results Management , and investigations or proceedings relating to violations of Article 5.10.14 (Status During Ineligibility or Provisional Suspension). Doubles Pair: Set of two table tennis players associated to compete together according to the table tennis rules for doubles events. 5: ITTF Anti-Doping Rules ITTF Statutes 2025 Page 158 Education: The process of learning to instill values and develop behaviors that foster and protect the spirit of sport, and to prevent intentional and unintentional doping. Event: A series of individual Competitions conducted together under one ruling body (e.g., the Olympic Games, World Championships, or Pan American Games). Event Period: The time between the beginning and end of an Event, as established by the ruling body of the Event. For ITTF, the Event Period is considered the period which starts at 11:59 p.m. of the day before the Event and finishes at 11:59 p.m. of the day on which the Event ends. Event Venues: Those venues so designated by the ruling body for the Event. For ITTF, it means that part of the event building used for Table Tennis and its related activities (including official training), facilities and public areas. Fault: Fault is any breach of duty or any lack of care appropriate to a particular situation. Factors to be taken into consideration in assessing an Athlete’s or other Person’s degree of Fault include, for example, the Athlete’s or other Person’s experience, whether the Athlete or other Person is a Protected Person, special considerations such as impairment, the degree of risk that should have been perceived by the Athlete and the level of care and investigation exercised by the Athlete in relation to what should have been the perceived level of risk. In assessing the Athlete’s or other Person’s degree of Fault, the circumstances considered must be specific and relevant to explain the Athlete’s or other Person’s departure from the expected standard of behaviour. Thus, for example, the fact that an Athlete would lose the opportunity to earn large sums of money during a period of Ineligibility, or the fact that the Athlete only has a short time left in a career, or the timing of the sporting calendar, would not be relevant factors to be considered in reducing the period of Ineligibility under Article 5.10.6.1 or 5.10.6.2. 77 Financial Consequences: See Consequences of Anti-Doping Rule Violations above. In-Competition: The period commencing at 11:59 p.m. on the day before a Competition in which the Athlete is scheduled to participate through the end of such Competition and the Sample collection process related to such Competition. 78 Independent Observer Program: A team of observers and/or auditors, under the supervision of WADA, who observe and provide guidance on the Doping Control process prior to or during certain Events and report on their observations as part of WADA’s compliance monitoring program. Individual Sport: Any sport that is not a Team Sport. Ineligibility: See Consequences of Anti-Doping Rule Violations above. 77  [Comment to Fault: The criteria for assessing an Athlete’s degree of Fault is the same under all Articles where Fault is to be considered. However, under Article 5.10.6.2, no reduction of sanction is appropriate unless, when the degree of Fault is assessed, the conclusion is that No Significant Fault or Negligence on the part of the Athlete or other Person was involved.] 78  [Comment to In -Competition: Having a universally accepted definition for In -Competition provides greater harmonization among Athletes across all sports, eliminates or reduces confusion among Athletes about the relevant timeframe for In-Competition Testing, avoids inadvertent Adverse Analytical Findings in between Competitions during an Event and assists in preventing any potentia l performance enhancement benefits from substances prohibited Out -of-Competition being carried over to the Competition period.] 5: ITTF Anti-Doping Rules ITTF Statutes 2025 Page 159 Institutional Independence: Hearing panels on appeal shall be fully independent institutionally from the Anti-Doping Organization responsible for Results Management. They must therefore not in any way be administered by, connected or subject to the Anti-Doping Organization responsible for Results Management. International Event: An Event or Competition where the International Olympic Committee, the International Paralympic Committee, an International Federation, a  Major Event Organization, or another international sport organization is the ruling body for the  Event or appoints the technical officials for the Event. International-Level Athlete: Athletes who compete in sport at the international level, as defined by each International Federation, consistent with the International Standard for Testing and Investigations. For the sport of table tennis, International-Level Athletes are defined as set out in the Scope section of the Introduction to these Anti-Doping Rules. 79 International Standard: A standard adopted by WADA in support of the Code. Compliance with an International Standard (as opposed to another alternative standard, practice or procedure) shall be sufficient to conclude that the procedures addressed by the International Standard were performed properly. International Standards shall include any Technical Documents issued pursuant to the International Standard. Major Event Organizations: The continental associations of National Olympic Committees and other international multi-sport organizations that function as the ruling body for any continental, regional or other International Event. Marker: A compound, group of compounds or biological variable(s) that indicates the Use of a Prohibited Substance or Prohibited Method. Metabolite: Any substance produced by a biotransformation process. Minimum Reporting Level: The estimated concentration of a Prohibited Substance or its Metabolite(s) or Marker(s) in a Sample below which WADA-accredited laboratories should not report that Sample as an Adverse Analytical Finding. Minor: A natural Person who has not reached the age of eighteen (18) years. National Anti-Doping Organization: The entity(ies) designated by each country as possessing the primary authority and responsibility to adopt and implement anti-doping rules, direct the collection of Samples, the management of test results, and the conduct of hearings at the national level. If this designation has not been made by the competent public authority(ies), the entity shall be the country’s National Olympic Committee or its designee. 79  [Comment to International- Level Athlete: Consistent with the International Standard for Testing and Investigations, ITTF is free to determine the criteria it will use to classify Athletes as International -Level Athletes, e.g., by ranking, by participation in particular International Events, by type of license, etc. However, it must publish those criteria in clear and concise form, so that Athletes are able to ascertain quickly and easily when they will become classified as International -Level Athletes. For example, if the criteria include participation in certain International Events, then the International Federation must publish a list of those International E vents.] 5: ITTF Anti-Doping Rules ITTF Statutes 2025 Page 160 National Event : A sport Event or Competition involving International- or National-Level Athletes that is not an International Event. Member Association: A national or regional entity which is a member of or is recognized by ITTF as the entity governing ITTF's sport in that nation or region. National-Level Athlete: Athletes who compete in sport at the national level, as defined by each National Anti-Doping Organization, consistent with the International Standard for Testing and Investigations. National Olympic Committee: The organization recognized by the International Olympic Committee. The term National Olympic Committee shall also include the National Sport Confederation in those countries where the National Sport Confederation assumes typical National Olympic Committee responsibilities in the anti-doping area. No Fault or Negligence: The Athlete or other Person's establishing that he or she did not know or suspect, and could not reasonably have known or suspected even with the exercise of utmost caution, that he or she had Used or been administered the Prohibited Substance or Prohibited Method or otherwise violated an anti-doping rule. Except in the case of a Protected Person or Recreational Athlete, for any violation of Article 5.2.1, the Athlete must also establish how the Prohibited Substance entered the Athlete’s system. No Significant Fault or Negligence: The Athlete or other Person's establishing that any Fault or Negligence, when viewed in the totality of the circumstances and taking into account the criteria for No Fault or Negligence, was not significant in relationship to the anti-doping rule violation. Except in the case of a Protected Person or Recreational Athlete, for any violation of Article 5.2.1, the Athlete must also establish how the Prohibited Substance entered the Athlete’s system. Operational Independence : This means that (1) board members, staff members, commission members, consultants and officials of the Anti-Doping Organization with responsibility for Results Management  or its affiliates (e.g., member federation or confederation), as well as any Person involved in the investigation and pre-adjudication of the matter cannot be appointed as members and/or clerks (to the extent that such clerk is involved in the deliberation process and/or drafting of any decision) of hearing panels of that Anti-Doping Organization with responsibility for Results Management and (2) hearing panels shall be in a position to conduct the hearing and decision-making process without interference from the Anti-Doping Organization or any third party. The objective is to ensure that members of the hearing panel or individuals otherwise involved in the decision of the hearing panel, are not involved in the investigation of, or decisions to proceed with, the case. Out-of-Competition: Any period which is not In-Competition. Participant: Any Athlete or Athlete Support Person. Person: A natural Person or an organization or other entity. Possession: The actual, physical Possession, or the constructive Possession (which shall be found only if the Person has exclusive control or intends to exercise control over the Prohibited Substance or Prohibited Method or the premises in which a Prohibited Substance or Prohibited Method exists); provided, however, that if the Person does not have exclusive 5: ITTF Anti-Doping Rules ITTF Statutes 2025 Page 161 control over the Prohibited Substance or Prohibited Method or the premises in which a Prohibited Substance or Prohibited Method exists, constructive Possession shall only be found if the Person knew about the presence of the Prohibited Substance or Prohibited Method and intended to exercise control over it. Provided, however, there shall be no anti- doping rule violation based solely on Possession if, prior to receiving notification of any kind that the Person has committed an anti-doping rule violation, the Person has taken concrete action demonstrating that the Person never intended to have Possession and has renounced Possession by explicitly declaring it to an Anti-Doping Organization. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this definition, the purchase (including by any electronic or other means) of a Prohibited Substance or Prohibited Method constitutes Possession by the Person who makes the purchase.80 Prohibited List: The List identifying the Prohibited Substances and Prohibited Methods. Prohibited Method: Any method so described on the Prohibited List. Prohibited Substance: Any substance, or class of substances, so described on the Prohibited List. Protected Person: An Athlete or other natural Person who at the time of the anti-doping rule violation: (i) has not reached the age of sixteen (16) years; (ii) has not reached the age of eighteen (18) years and is not included in any Registered Testing Pool and has never competed in any International Event in an open category; or (iii) for reasons other than age has been determined to lack legal capacity under applicable national legislation. 81 Provisional Hearing: For purposes of Article 5.7.4.3, an expedited abbreviated hearing occurring prior to a hearing under Article 5.8 that provides the Athlete with notice and an opportunity to be heard in either written or oral form. 82 Provisional Suspension: See Consequences of Anti-Doping Rule Violations above. Publicly Disclose: See Consequences of Anti-Doping Rule Violations above. Recreational Athlete: A natural Person who is so defined by the relevant National Anti- Doping Organization; provided, however, the term shall not include any Person who, within the five (5) years prior to committing any anti-doping rule violation, has been an International-Level Athlete (as defined by each International Federation consistent with the 80  [Comment to Possession: Under this definition, anabolic steroids found in an Athlete's car would constitute a violation unless the Athlete establishes that someone else used the car; in that event, ITTF must establish that, even though the Athlete did not have exclusive control over the car, the Athlete knew about the anabolic steroids and intended to have control over them.  Similarly, in the example of anabolic steroids found in a home medicine cabinet under the joint control of an Athlete and spouse, ITTF must establish that the Athlete knew the anabolic steroids were in the cabinet and that the Athlete intended to exercise control over them. The act of purchasing a Prohibited Substance alone constitutes Possession, even where, for example, the product does not arrive, is rece ived by someone else, or is sent to a third -party address.] 81  [Comment to Protected Person: The Code treats Protected Persons differently than other Athletes or Persons in certain circumstances based on the understanding that, below a certain age or intellectual capacity, an Athlete or other Person may not possess the mental capacity to understand and appreciate the prohibitions against conduct contained in the Code. This would include, for example , a Paralympic Athlete with a documented lack of legal capacity due to an intellectual impairment. The term “open category ” is meant to exclude competition that is limited to junior or age group categories.] 82  [Comment to Provisional Hearing: A Provisional Hearing is only a preliminary proceeding which may not involve a full review of the facts of the case. Following a Provisional Hearing, the Athlete remains entitled to a subsequent full hearing on the merits of the case. By contrast, an “expedited hearing”, as that term is used in Article 5.7.4.3, is a full hearing on the merits conducted on an expedited time schedule.] 5: ITTF Anti-Doping Rules ITTF Statutes 2025 Page 162 International Standard for Testing and Investigations) or National-Level Athlete (as defined by each National Anti-Doping Organization consistent with the International Standard for Testing and Investigations), has represented any country in an International Event in an open category or has been included within any Registered Testing Pool or other whereabouts information pool maintained by any International Federation or National Anti- Doping Organization.83 Regional Anti-Doping Organization: A regional entity designated by member countries to coordinate and manage delegated areas of their national anti-doping programs, which may include the adoption and implementation of anti-doping rules, the planning and collection of Samples, the management of results, the review of TUEs, the conduct of hearings, and the conduct of Educational programs at a regional level. Registered Testing Pool: The pool of highest-priority Athletes established separately at the international level by International Federations and at the national level by National Anti- Doping Organizations, who are subject to focused In-Competition and Out-of-Competition Testing as part of that International Federation's or National Anti-Doping Organization's test distribution plan and therefore are required to provide whereabouts information as provided in Article 5.5.5 and the International Standard for Testing and Investigations. Results Management: The process encompassing the timeframe between notification as per Article 5 of the International Standard for Results Management, or in certain cases (e.g., Atypical Finding, Athlete Biological Passport , whereabouts failure), such pre-notification steps expressly provided for in Article 5 of the International Standard for Results Management, through the charge until the final resolution of the matter, including the end of the hearing process at first instance or on appeal (if an appeal was lodged).

ITTF Statutes 2025 Page 256 CODE OF CONDUCT ON SPORTS BETTING FOR PLAYERS AND OFFICIALS This Code of Conduct sets out the guiding principles for all table tennis players and officials (technical, team and administrative) on the issues surrounding the integrity of sport and betting. Guiding Principles 1. Be Smart: know the rules 2. Be Safe: never bet on table tennis 3. Be Careful: never share sensitive information 4. Be Clean: never fix an event 5. Be Open: tell someone if you are approached 1.  Be Smart: know the rules Find out the sports betting integrity rules of the ITTF and your Member Association, team, club, Athletes’ Commission, competition and your country’s laws, before the start of each season so that you are aware of the ITTF’s most recent position regarding betting. Many sports and countries either have or are developing regulations on sports betting and you need to be aware of these – even if you do not bet. If you break the rules, you will be caught and risk severe punishment including a potential lifetime ban from table tennis and even being subject to a criminal investigation. 2.  Be Safe: never bet on table tennis Never bet on yourself, your opponent or table tennis. If you, or anyone in your entourage (coach, family members, etc .,), bet on you, your opponent or table tennis, you risk being severely sanctioned. It is best to play safe and never bet on any events within table tennis including: • never betting or gambling on your own matches or any competitions (including betting on yourself or your team to win, lose or draw as well as any of the different side-bets); • never instructing, encouraging or facilitating any other party to bet on table tennis; • never ensuring the occurrence of a particular incident, which is the subject of a bet and for which you expect to receive or have received any reward; •  never giving or receiving any gift, payment or other benefit in circumstances that might reasonably be expected to bring you or table tennis into disrepute. Code of Conduct on Sports Betting for Players and Officials ITTF Statutes 2025 Page 257 3.  Be Careful: never share sensitive information As a player or official you will have access to information that is not available to the general public, such as knowing that a star player is injured or that the coach is putting out a weakened side. This is considered sensitive, privileged or inside information. This information could be sought by people who would then use that knowledge to secure an unfair advantage and make a financial gain. There is nothing wrong with you having sensitive information; it is what you do with it that matters. Most players know that they should not discuss important information with anyone outside of their club or coaching staff (with or without reward) where th e player might reasonably be expected to know that its disclosure could be used in relation to betting. The same applies to officials. 4.  Be Clean: never fix an event Play and officiate fairly, honestly and never fix an event or part of an event. Whatever the reason, do not make any attempt to influence adversely the natural course of a table tennis event or part of an event. Sporting competitions must always be an honest test of skill and ability and the results must remain uncertain. Fixing an event, or part of an event goes against the rules and ethics of sport and when caught, you may receive a criminal prosecution and a lifetime ban from table tennis. Do not put yourself at risk by following these simple principles: • Always perform to the best of your abilities (play to your potential and umpire fairly). • Never accept to fix a match. Say no immediately. Do not let yourself be manipulated - unscrupulous individuals might try to develop a relationship with you built on favours or fears that they will then try to exploit for their benefit in possibly fixing an event. This can include the offer of gifts, money or other support. • Avoid addictions or running up debts as this may be a trigger for unscrupulous individuals to target you to fix competitions. Get help before things get out of control. 5.  Be Open: tell someone if you are approached If you hear something suspicious or if anyone approaches you to ask about fixing any part of a match then you should tell the Athletes’ Commission, the ITTF (competition manager or referee), the Umpires and Referees Committee (if you are a technical official) or someone you trust straight away. If someone offers you money or favours for sensitive information then you should also tell the ITTF or Athletes’ Commission. Any threats or suspicions of corrupt behaviour must always be reported. The police and national laws are there to protect you. Your club, your Association or your Athletes’ Commission will help. If in doubt as to who to contact, email: integrity@ittf.com.",
